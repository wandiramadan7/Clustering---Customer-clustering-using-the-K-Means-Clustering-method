#Customer-clustering-using-the-K-Means-Clustering-method
In this respository, I would like to share about the cluster analysis that I have made. I have created a cluster analysis with the K-Means Clustering method. Cluster analysis is an analysis to cluster or group elements that have the same characteristics into a cluster. Grouping is said to be good when each unit in a cluster has a high similarity or homogeneity, and a high difference between groups with one another or called heterogeneity.This cluster analysis aims to cluster consumers of a product. In this analysis, the steps taken are as follows:
1. Setting up the Libarary
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Data Encoding
4. Data Standardization
5. Multicollinearity test
6. Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)
7. K-Means
